# Day-3-Who-pays-the-bills-project
Welcome to Day 3 of my Python coding journey! In today’s project, we build a fun and practical mini-program called "Who Will Pay the Bills?" using Python’s random module.  This project teaches you how to take multiple user inputs, store them in a list, and let Python randomly choose one person to pay the bill.
